                    Have Heart was a hardcore punk band from Boston, Massachusetts that formed in 2002 and disbanded in 2009. Their music was known for its passion, energy, and politically charged lyrics, which often dealt with issues such as animal rights, veganism, and the straight edge lifestyle.
                    The band released several acclaimed albums and EPs during their career, including their debut LP "The Things We Carry" in 2006, which is still considered a classic of the genre. Have Heart was also known for their intense live shows, which often included passionate and emotionally charged performances by lead singer Pat Flynn.
                    Despite their relatively short career, Have Heart left a lasting impact on the hardcore punk scene and continues to inspire new generations of fans. Their music and message remain relevant today, and their legacy is a testament to the power of punk rock as a force for social change.
