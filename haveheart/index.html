                Have Heart: The Boston Hardcore Band That Defined a Generation

                Have Heart was a hardcore punk band from Boston, Massachusetts that was active from 2002 to 2009. The band consisted of vocalist Pat Flynn, guitarist Ryan Hudon, bassist Ryan Briggs, and drummer Shawn Costa. During their time together, they released three full-length albums and a handful of EPs and singles, and were known for their socially conscious lyrics and high-energy live performances.
                
                Origins and Early Career
                
                Have Heart was formed in 2002 in the Boston suburb of New Bedford by Pat Flynn and Ryan Hudon, who were both still in high school at the time. They were heavily influenced by the straight edge punk scene and the positive message it espoused, and quickly developed a reputation for their intense live shows and politically charged lyrics.
                
                In 2004, the band self-released their debut EP, What Counts, which helped them gain a following in the Boston hardcore scene. They followed this up with their first full-length album, The Things We Carry, in 2006, which was released on Bridge Nine Records and featured some of their most well-known songs, including "Armed With a Mind" and "Watch Me Rise."
                
                Musical Style and Themes
                
                Have Heart's music was characterized by fast, aggressive guitar riffs, pounding drums, and Pat Flynn's raw, emotionally charged vocals. Their lyrics tackled issues like animal rights, social justice, and personal empowerment, and often emphasized the importance of community and self-respect.
                
                Despite the intensity of their music and message, Have Heart were also known for their positive and inclusive attitude towards their fans, and frequently encouraged audience members to take care of each other and treat one another with respect.
                
                Breakup and Legacy
                
                In 2009, Have Heart announced that they would be breaking up following a final show in their hometown of Boston. The news came as a shock to many fans, who had come to see the band as a leading voice in the hardcore scene.
                
                In the years since their breakup, Have Heart's influence has only grown, with many bands citing them as an inspiration and continuing to cover their songs at shows. Pat Flynn has also remained active in the music scene, playing with the band Fiddlehead and working as a high school teacher in Massachusetts.
