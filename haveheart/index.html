        <h3>Brief history</h3>
        <p>
            Part of the resurgent Boston hardcore scene, Have Heart formed in 2002 around the core lineup of singer Patrick Flynn, guitarist Ryan Hudon, and bassist Ryan Briggs. Hailing from the coastal town of New Bedford, the trio moved to Boston after graduating high school. Initially working with a revolving lineup of local musicians, the band played their first show in July 2003, and in November, their debut demo was released. The demo came to the attention of Think Fast! Records, who signed them for the release of the What Counts EP in 2004. The EP showcased long-time guitarist Ben Kelly and drummer Justin Paling.

            In 2005, Have Heart moved to the estimable hardcore indie Bridge Nine Records and underwent a lineup change, with Kelly and Paling replaced by Kei Yasui and Shawn Costa, respectively.[2] The following year they released The Things We Carry, their first full length. In 2007, the band toured through the U.S., Canada and Europe.[3]

            In 2008, the band released their second full-length album on Bridge Nine, Songs to Scream at the Sun, which debuted and peaked at No. 193 on the Billboard 200 and No. 16 on the Top Heatseekers chart.
